### b)
Utilizando o comando descdist e mostre as estatísticas geradas.
```{r}
  descdist(dados_1, discrete = FALSE, graph = FALSE)
```
```{r}
  descdist(dados_2, discrete = FALSE, graph = FALSE)
```

### c)
Utilizando o comando fitdist para o primeiro conjunto de dados, temos:
```{r}
  fit.weibull_1 <- fitdist(dados_1, "weibull")
  fit.gamma_1 <- fitdist(dados_1, "gamma")
  fit.lognormal_1 <- fitdist(dados_1, "lnorm")
  fit.normal_1 <- fitdist(dados_1, "norm")
  fit.expo_1 <- fitdist(dados_1, "exp")
  fit.gamma_1
  plot(fit.gamma_1)
```
Eh provavel que o primeiro conjunto de dados seja melhor descrito pela distribuicao gama, uma vez que eh a distribuicao que apresenta menor erro relativo para o ajuste e possui melhor alinhamento as retas dos graficos
\newline
\newline
Agora, utilizando o comando fitdist para o segundo conjunto de dados, temos:
```{r}
  fit.weibull_2 <- fitdist(dados_2, "weibull")
  fit.gamma_2 <- fitdist(dados_2, "gamma")
  fit.lognormal_2 <- fitdist(dados_2, "lnorm")
  fit.normal_2 <- fitdist(dados_2, "norm")
  fit.expo_2 <- fitdist(dados_2, "exp")
  fit.expo_2
  plot(fit.expo_2)
```
Eh provavel que o segundo conjunto de dados seja melhor descrito pela distribuicao exponencial, uma vez que eh a distribuicao possui melhor alinhamento as retas dos graficos
\newline
\newline
**d)**
\newline
Para os dados 1:
```{r descdist dos Dados 1, results="hide"}
  descdist(dados_1, discrete = FALSE)
```
De acordo com grafico, eh possivel perceber que a amostra de dados se aproxima mais de uma distribuicao gama, ja que o ponto azul se aproxima mais da reta tracejada.
Agora, para os dados 2:
```{r descdist dos Dados 2, results="hide"}
  descdist(dados_2, discrete = FALSE)
```
De acordo com grafico, eh possivel perceber que a amostra de dados se aproxima mais de uma distribuicao exponencial, ja que o ponto azul se aproxima mais do ponto marcado como exponencial.
\newline
\newline
**e)**
\newline
Para os dados 1:
```{r}
  fit.weibull_1$aic
  fit.gamma_1$aic
  fit.lognormal_1$aic
  fit.normal_1$aic
  fit.expo_1$aic
```
Como o AIC do fit da gama eh o menor, percebe-se que, de fato, o ajuste para a distruibuicao gama eh o melhor dentre os demais para o primeiro conjunto de dados.
\newline
\newline
Agora, para os dados 2:
```{r}
  fit.weibull_2$aic
  fit.gamma_2$aic
  fit.lognormal_2$aic
  fit.normal_2$aic
  fit.expo_2$aic
```
Como o AIC do fit da exponencial eh o menor, percebe-se que, de fato, o ajuste para a distruibuicao exponencial eh o melhor dentre os demais para o segundo conjunto de dados.
\newline
\newline
**f)**
\newline
```{r}
  ks.test(dados_1, "pgamma", 3.027141, 2.032940, exact=FALSE)
```
```{r}
  ks.test(dados_2, "pexp", 3.291175, exact=FALSE)
```
Como os p-valores sao 0.796 e 0.9789 para, respectivamente, os testes da gamma e da exponencial, podemos concluir que os ajustes sao adequados, uma vez que os p-valores sao superiores a 5%.
